## Playing "Mr. Potato Head" with Accelerated Sampling Algorithms: 

#### Alchemical Metadynamics ($\lambda$-MetaD)

Use these links for the [final published version](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.2c01258) and [preprint version](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.01329) of the  "Alchemical Metadynamics: Adding Alchemical Variables to Metadynamics to Enhance Sampling in Free Energy Calculations"

Example from the paper can be found at [Alchemical Metadynamics PLUMED nest entry](https://www.plumed-nest.org/eggs/23/003/) with the [GitHub repository of the examples here](https://github.com/shirtsgroup/alchemical_metadynamics_project).

#### Replica Exchange of Expanded Ensembles (REXEE)

Use these links for the [final published version](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.4c00484) and [preprint version](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.06938) of "Replica Exchange of Expanded Ensembles: A Generalized Ensemble Approach with Enhanced Flexibility and Parallelizability".

The GitHub repository of examples is at [https://github.com/shirtsgroup/ensemble_md/](https://github.com/shirtsgroup/ensemble_md/)

#### Multiple Topology REXEE (MT-REXEE)

Here's the [preprint of the MT-REXEE study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11038)!  The current code can be found at the (MT-REXEE itHub Repository](https://github.com/ajfriedman22/MT-REXEE)

#### Context of combining methods in enhanced sampling.
